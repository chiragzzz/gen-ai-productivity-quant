# Gen AI for Quantitative Research Analyst Productivity

This repository explores the use of Generative AI for productivity enhancement across the lifecycle of a Quantitative Research Analyst — including research automation, documentation, interview preparation, and coding workflows.

## 🔍 Objective

To apply Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot) for:

- 📊 Quant research ideation and documentation  
- 🧠 Prompt engineering for data analysis workflows  
- 🧾 Resume and portfolio refinement  
- 💼 Interview preparation (behavioral + technical)  
- 🔄 Automating repetitive tasks in the quant research pipeline

## 🚀 Tools

- OpenAI (ChatGPT-4o)  
- Claude / Copilot (as applicable)  
- Python, Pandas, SQL (within prompts and tests)  
- Notion (task tracking & project planning)  

## 📌 Notes

- This project is not just about using AI for answers, but about enhancing *thinking*, *workflow clarity*, and *speed* in quant research tasks.  
- Focus remains on applying Gen AI meaningfully — not replacing critical thinking.

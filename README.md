# 🤖 GenAI for Quantitative Research

This repository showcases practical projects where Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, and Mistral are used to **accelerate real-world Quantitative Research workflows**. It includes tools, prompts, and utilities to improve productivity across strategy design, reporting, and documentation.

---

## 🧭 Project Goals

- Build **LLM-based tools** that assist in real quant workflows — not just theory.
- Automate tedious research tasks: documentation, analysis, report generation.
- Use GenAI as a **copilot**, not a replacement, for quantitative reasoning.
